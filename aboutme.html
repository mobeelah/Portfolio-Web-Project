                    Ever since I can remember, Iâ€™d always wanted to be an inventor or an innovator when I grew up. As I grew, I realized that I could be the Thomas Edison or the Da-Vinci of this generation but through a new path. This path is computer science and it leads to my dream of being an innovative and creative mind.

                    I am a DePaul undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science with a focus in Software Development. Three years of rigorous curriculum has made me proficient in the Java and Python language. Through an internship, I also have explored the worlds of Data Science and am currently training in Microsoft Access and Alteryx.
